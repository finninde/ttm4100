Login sequence diagram:

Client connects to the server (client handler) with a JSON object.
Server checks that the username is valid and unique. 
	1: If it is valid it forwards the connection and username to ThreadedTCPServer. 
	Which creates a new worker and adds the username as a key in the dictionary which reffers to the worker object.
	The newly created worker sends all earlier messages back to the client. 
	2: Invalid username, sends a error message back to the client. 
	3: A username already taken will also create a error message back to the client.
